# Balancing-Robot
This repo will hold all the relevant files relating to my balancing robot. This is my first time using git, so let's just we how it goes. 

This project is a 2-wheel balancing robot. For now I'm just trying to get it to balance and control its movements with a remote. Later I will add sensors like a camera and give it more functionality.
